# TestMatch
A data-driven simulator of test cricket, built upon historical ball-by-ball data to simulate a full match. The simulation itself is built in C++


## Setup
The project is currently not in a useable state, but once it is more developed this section will outline how to get the simulator working.


## Dependencies


## Breakdown
Loosely, the project is broken into several smaller goals:
* Developing a model for ball-by-ball simulation, in Python via data scraped from ESPNCricInfo.
* Developing the simulation backend itself in C++, initially as a console program outputting to a custom file format.
* Designing and developing a GUI using the Qt library, to make the tool easier to use.

## Sources & Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by Jamee999's test cricket simulator written in Python. I wanted to create a more robust and detailed simulator based upon real data.
